# Builder Pattern

Builder pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its
representation so that the same construction process can create different
representations.

In Go, normally a configuration struct is used to achieve the same behavior,
however passing a struct to the builder method fills the code with boilerplate
`if cfg.Field != nil {...}` checks.
